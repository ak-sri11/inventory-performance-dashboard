**End-to-End Excel Dashboard Project**  
This project demonstrates my ability to design, analyze, and deliver **data-driven business insights** using Excel. It simulates inventory coverage, supplier performance, and availability tracking across multiple categories and markets.  

Recruiters and hiring managers can view this repository as a **sample of my analytics, reporting, and dashboard-building expertise**.

## 🔹 Business Problem  
Companies in supply chain & operations need to track:  
- **Coverage %** → How much stock is available by category/market.  
- **Supplier Reliability** → Identifying best vs. worst suppliers using fill rate & delay rates.  
- **Adjusted Availability** → Inventory adjusted for product returns, giving a more realistic KPI.  
- **Trends vs. Targets** → Monitoring month-to-month performance against targets (e.g., 85% coverage).  

This dashboard brings all of these KPIs into **one view for decision-making**.
